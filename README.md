# Salary-Prediction-Model

Predicting salaries based on various job-related parameters using machine learning.

## Introduction

This project focuses on predicting average salaries using a machine learning model. Leveraging a dataset sourced from Glassdoor jobs via Kaggle, the model takes into account key parameters such as job title, company rating, location, company size, type of ownership, industry, and sector to estimate average salaries.

## Features

- Utilizes a diverse set of features including job title, company rating, and location.
- Implements label encoding for categorical variables and handles missing values appropriately.
- Employs standard scaling for numerical features to ensure model effectiveness.
